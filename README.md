Hangman Game

Overview:
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game written in Python.
The player guesses letters in an attempt to figure out the hidden word. With
each wrong guess, a part of the hangman drawing appears. The game ends when
the player either successfully guesses the word or completes the hangman figure.

Features:
Random word generation from a pre-defined list.
A visual hangman representation as the player makes incorrect guesses.
User-friendly input and display of the word and guessed letters.
Customizable word list for different levels of difficulty.
